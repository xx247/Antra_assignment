1. #### Describe the problem generics address.

   1. Type safety
   2. Better Performance: 
   3. Flexibility 
   4. Maintainability

2. #### How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?

   ```C#
   List<string> stringList = new List<string>();
   ```

   

3. #### How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?

   two

4. #### True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.

   False

5. #### What method is used to add items to a List object?

   'add'

6. #### Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.

   'Remove' and 'RemoveAt'

7. #### How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?

   To indicate that a class has a generic type parameter, you define the class with a type parameter in angle brackets (`<>`) after the class name.

8. #### True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.

   False

9. #### True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.

   True

10. #### True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.

â€‹	True
